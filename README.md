# JavaScript Oracle of Delphi

### A ~black magic~ simple JS program to "predict" a date and cause of death.

The program will pick a year from 2024 to 2073, a month, a day, and one of, currently, 6 possible causes and print them to console in a suitably oracular fashion (although rather more directly than one might expect from the Oracle of Delphi).

## Requirements

Requires node.js to be installed.

## How to run

Simply download the single file random-messages.js, open a terminal, navigate to the file's location and type node random-messages.js.
